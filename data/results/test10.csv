Christina Aguilera),CeeLo Green,"I really can't stay Baby it's cold outside I've got to go away Baby it's cold out there This evening has been Been hoping that you'd drop in So very nice I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice My mother will start to worry Beautiful, what's your hurry? My father will be pacing the floor Listen to that fireplace roar So really I'd better scurry Beautiful, please don't hurry Well maybe just a half a drink more Why don't you put some records on while I pour The neighbors might think Baby, it's bad out there Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there I wish I knew how Your eyes are like starlight To break the spell I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell I ought to say no, no, no, sir Mind if I move in closer? At least I'm gonna say that I tried What's the sense in hurting my pride? I really can't stay Baby don't hold out Baby it's cold outside I simply must go See that it's cold outside The answer is no I said it's cold out there This welcome has been How lucky that you dropped in So nice and warm Look out the window at that storm My sister will be suspicious Gosh, your lips look delicious My brother will be there at the door Waves upon a tropical shore My maiden aunt's mind is vicious Oh, your lips are delicious Maybe just a cigarette more Never such a blizzard before Hey I've got to go home Baby, you'll freeze out there Say, lend me your coat It's up to your knees out there You've really been grand I'm thrilled when you touch my hand But don't you see How can you do this thing to me? There's bound to be talk tomorrow Think of my life long sorrow At least there will be plenty implied If you caught pneumonia and died I really can't stay Get over that old lie Baby, baby it's cold outside",CeeLo's Magic Moment,Christmas Soul,r&b
